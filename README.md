First big project. This came from school.

We were tasked with making a "Rekenwebsite" for "Basisschool de Splinter". It's completely written with html/css/php, and uses 0 framework to assist with this, all the css is hand-written, and as a result, not great. I did end up getting really high grades for this project, whilst the front-end is heavily lacking, this has never been my interest. I am bad at design, nor do I enjoy it. 

The back-end however is what got me good grades, it was all functional, and incorporated things that were outside of the direct scope of the task set by my teacher, just because I enjoyed working on it.
